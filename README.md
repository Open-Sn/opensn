# OpenSn #

OpenSn is a large-scale scientific simulation engine being developed at 
Texas A&M University as part of a research study on massively parallel 
algorithms for modeling and simulation. The main physics modules 
of OpenSn deal with solving the linear Boltzmann equation and 
diffusion-reaction physics.
