Introduction to Angular Quadratures
===================================

Discrete-ordinates codes need angular quadratures to select the sweeping directions and to compute moments of the angular flux.

Several choices are possible:

- A Product Quadrature set (using Gauss-Legendre quadrature along the polar angle, and a Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature along the azimuthal angle)
- A Linear Discontinuous Finite Element (LDFE) Quadrature set that allows for local angular refinement


Triangular Quadrature sets and Lebedev sets may be added in the future.
