Introduction to Logical Volumes
===============================

Logical volumes can be used to select a collection of cells for various purposes, such as
- assigning/modifying a `blockID`, or
- selecting a sub-region for post-processing purposes.
In the future, assigning/modifying a boundary ID should be possible.

A cell assignment to a logical volume is determined based on whether the cell centroid is inside the logical volume.
