Introduction to Cross Sections
==============================

OpenSn is not supplied with cross-section libraries.

Users are expected to supply their own cross-section data.

One may use other open-source software to generate multigroup cross sections (e.g., NJOY, Dragon, OpenMC).

We allow 3 cross-section input modes:

- using a built-in method to generate isotropic one-group cross sections
- reading an ASCII (text) file
- reading an HDF5 file generated by [OpenMC](https://docs.openmc.org/en/stable/index.html)
