# Plotting Angular Quadrature Discretization using a simple python script

Unfortunately no tutorials exist at this time. A guide follows below for instructions.

When running a problem that manipulates angular quadratures. Assuming the file base is "TestQuad_" the following 3 files will be created:
TestQuad_verts.csv
TestQuad_cells.csv
TestQuad_points.csv

1. Move all three of these files into this folder
2. In [plot_quadrature.py](plot_quadrature.py) edit line 8 to be the file base indicated above
3. Execute the python script
